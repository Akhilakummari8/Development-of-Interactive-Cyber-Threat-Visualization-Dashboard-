2. Detailed Architecture Components
1. Data Sources Layer

Provides raw cybersecurity data.

Sources include:

Firewall logs

IDS/IPS alerts

Server & application logs

Network traffic data

Simulated attack datasets

Threat intelligence feeds (MITRE ATT&CK, CVE, IOC data)

Purpose:
Collect diverse security events for centralized analysis.

2. Data Ingestion Layer

Responsible for collecting and storing incoming data.

Components:

Log collectors

Event listeners

ETL pipelines

Batch & real-time ingestion modules

Technologies (example):

Python scripts

Logstash / Fluentd (optional)

Scheduled jobs / streaming handlers

Purpose:
Ensure continuous, reliable data flow into the system.

3. Data Processing & Normalization Layer

Cleans and structures raw data.

Functions:

Data cleaning

Timestamp normalization

Deduplication

Severity classification

IP, port, protocol extraction

Output:
Structured threat records stored in databases.

4. Threat Intelligence & Correlation Engine

Core analytical layer of the system.

Responsibilities:

Correlate events across sources

Detect attack patterns

Map threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Risk scoring and prioritization

Identify anomaly behaviors

Techniques used:

Rule-based detection

Statistical analysis

Basic machine learning models (optional)

5. Data Storage Layer

Stores processed and historical data.

Databases:

Relational DB (SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL)

NoSQL DB (for logs and events)

Time-series storage (optional)

Stored Data:

Threat events

Attack timelines

Risk scores

User actions

Historical trends

6. Backend Services (API Layer)

Acts as the communication bridge between data and UI.

Components:

RESTful APIs

Authentication & authorization

Query handlers

Data aggregation services

Functions:

Fetch dashboard metrics

Filter data by time, severity, attack type

Provide real-time updates to UI

7. Visualization & Dashboard Layer

Transforms data into meaningful visuals.

Visual Elements:

Threat heatmaps

Attack timelines

Severity distribution charts

Geo-location attack maps

Top attackers & targets

Trend analysis graphs

Visualization Libraries:

Plotly

D3.js

Matplotlib / Dash

Chart.js

8. User Interface Layer

End-user interaction point.

Users:

Security analysts

SOC teams

System administrators

Features:

Interactive filters

Drill-down analysis

Real-time alert views

Downloadable reports

Role-based access

3. Security & Access Control Layer (Cross-Cutting)

Applied across all layers.

Includes:

User authentication

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Secure API endpoints

Audit logging

Data encryption (at rest & in transit)
